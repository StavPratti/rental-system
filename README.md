# rental-system

A full-stack rental platform connecting owners, tenants and admin.

Owners list properties for rent (enter pending, need admin approval).

Tenants search approved properties, submit rental applications, and request viewings.

Admin approves new listings, verifies tenants, manages users and overall operations.
