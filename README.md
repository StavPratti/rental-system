# rental-system
A full-stack rental system application using Java (Spring Boot, Gradle) 
and React with TypeScript

The system is a rental platform that connects property owners, tenants and the administrator:

Owners can list properties for rent.
Tenants can search for approved properties, submit rental applications and request viewings.
The administrator approves new listings, verifies tenants and oversees the overall operation of the system.

To run this app:

cd rental-frontend
npm run dev:all
